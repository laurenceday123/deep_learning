# Deep Learning
Storage of example code to build Deep Learning networks, with code built from Coursera.
- GANs in Pytorch, including [Deep Convolutional GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v1.pdf)

- Wasserstein Loss Function to alleviate mode collapse ([Great video here](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/mode-collapse-Terkm))


Future Ideas  
[Generation of Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11264.pdf)
- Samples from distribution and captures correlation between features, better than previously established statistical methods
